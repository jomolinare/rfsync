= Description =

This demo illustrates devices interaction while using FRSync Arduino library. 

===Characters===

  # Client
  # Server 
  # Observer


===Act===

  # *Client* puts in common data array, system time information.
  # *Server* takes from common data array information and put it in another position.
  # *Client* takes time information from another position (were it was placed by server), compare it with current time and calculate time that sycnronization takes.
  # All syncronization processes observes by the *Observer* 


= Hardware =

  # RF-2400P module - 2 pieces
  # Arduino board - 2 pieces
  # RF-2410U dongle  - 1 piece
  # PC running on Microsoft Windows - 1 piece

= Software =

  # RFSync Arduino library
  # Arduino sketch for the *Client*
  # Arduino sketch for the *Server*
  # Drivers for RF-2410U 
  # RF-2410U firmware
  # RF-2410U loader application.
  # *Observer* client application.
